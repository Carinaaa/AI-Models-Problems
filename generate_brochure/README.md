# AI Models Problems: Tutorial for Generating Company Brochures

This tutorial explains how to create a Python script that generates a company brochure using web scraping and OpenAI's API. The project demonstrates how to gather information from a target website, filter it for relevant links, and compile a final brochure in markdown format.

## General Scope of the Project

The goal of this project is to create a script that:
1. Scrapes a company's website to gather relevant data.
2. Uses OpenAI's language model to generate a brochure based on the gathered content.
3. Translates the brochure into another language (Romanian, in this case).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Necessary Python libraries:
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content.
  - `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
  - `openai`: To interact with the OpenAI API.
  - `requests`: To make HTTP requests.

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv openai requests
```

## Code Explanations

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the `open_ai_br.py` code:

### Constants and API Setup

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
import requests
import json
```
- Import necessary libraries.
- Set constants such as the model name.

### Website Scraping

```python
class Website:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        self.body = response.content
        ...
```
- The `Website` class initializes with a URL, sends a GET request to fetch the content, and parses it using BeautifulSoup.

### Link Filtering

```python
self.links = [link for link in links if link]
```
- This line extracts all clickable links from the page, filtering out any empty links.

### OpenAI API Interaction

```python
open_ai_response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[...]
)
```
- The code sends the scraped links and system prompts to the OpenAI API for processing. The response contains classified and filtered links relevant for the brochure.

### Brochure Generation

```python
open_ai_response_bro = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[...]
)
```
- Another API call generates the brochure content based on smart links considered relevant.

### Brochure Saving

```python
with open("brochure.md", "w", encoding="utf-8") as chat_response:
    chat_response.write(brochure)
```
- The generated content is saved as a markdown file for easy formatting.

### Translation

```python
open_ai_response_translate = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[...]
)
```
- The final step involves sending the English brochure for translation into Romanian, with the output saved in a separate markdown file.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure your `.env` file is set up with your OpenAI API key.
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python generate_brochure/open_ai_br.py
```

3. The project will generate `brochure.md` and `brochure_RO.md`.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how you can leverage web scraping and OpenAI's capabilities to create informative brochures for companies. By customizing the URLs and prompts, you can adapt the script to different companies or purposes. This approach illustrates not just automation but also the ability to process natural language effectively using modern AI tools. Have fun exploring more features and customizing the project to fit your needs!
