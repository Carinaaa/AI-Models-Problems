# AI Models Problems: Project Overview

*This text is generated by GPT-4o-mini.*

## General Scope of the Project

The AI Models Problems repository encompasses various projects that utilize advanced AI frameworks to tackle diverse tasks. From generating jokes with different large language models (LLMs) to creating company brochures and classifying pet store products, the aim is to demonstrate practical applications of AI in natural language processing and web-based solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin working with these projects, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.6 or higher** installed.
- Necessary libraries for specific projects, which can be installed using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- An environment variable set up for your OpenAI API key, as well as other required API keys based on different projects (e.g., Claude, Gemini).
- Access to Google Colab or a similar notebook interface for most demonstrations.

## Code Explanation

### 1. Generating Jokes

This part utilizes different large language models to generate jokes. The relevant notebook reads user prompts, sets up system messages, and interacts with the appropriate APIs.

**Code Workflow**
- Install necessary libraries (e.g., `anthropic`).
- Define system and user messages to engage the model.
- Execute the completion request and print the generated joke.

### 2. Creating Company Brochures

The brochure generation project scrapes a companyâ€™s website, extracts useful links, and compiles content into a user-friendly brochure format.

**Code Workflow**
- Scrape website content using BeautifulSoup.
- Classify useful links for brochure inclusion via proprietary AI API calls.
- Generate the brochure content and save it in markdown format.
- Optionally, translate the content into another language.

### 3. Restaurant Dialogue Simulation

This project is focused on creating a conversation simulation in a restaurant setting involving a cook, a waiter, and a critical diner (Gemini model).

**Code Workflow**
- Set up personas (e.g., waiter, cook, diner) with defined roles.
- Generate conversations between these roles to simulate a dining experience.
- Execute multiple interactions and store them for further processing.

### 4. CV Suggestions

This workflow reads an existing CV from a PDF, extracts text, and then uses a language model to suggest enhancements for making the CV more appealing.

**Code Workflow**
- Use PyPDF2 to extract text from the CV file.
- Generate suggestions through structured prompts to the language model.
- Display suggestions in a user-friendly format.

### 5. Classification of Pet Store Products

This project classifies product offerings for a pet store, creating pages that present various product categories.

**Code Workflow**
- Setup directories for products, sales, and company information.
- Utilize the language model to generate detailed product descriptions.
- Store each product's details in organized markdown files for a knowledge base.

## Running the Projects

### General Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-Models-Problems
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Ensure you have your API keys set in your environment.

3. **Run the Specific Notebook**: Open the desired notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially to see the outputs.

   Example for Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
